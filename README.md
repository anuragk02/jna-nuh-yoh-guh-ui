# jna-nuh-yoh-guh-ui

This is a simple project to interact with my backend for the jna-nuh-yoh-guh project which implements APIs to Interact with a Graph Database set up using Neo4j.

For now the scope is simple, The backend will be hosted on localhost right now, this frontend should have a simple interface with one page that has an Inut field, big enough for me to write an essay, if there is a minimal simple element resempling a text editor that could be used as well, I want to be able to write my essay here and click save to call the POST API to persist this essay.

On the Home page I want a simple scrollable element which presents the list of all Essays, And an Option to Edit and Delete on the right side of the title on each Essay element in the scrollable list.

That is it for now, I want to be able to Click on the list of essays and look at the Essays(Read), Post new Essays, Update Essays, and Delete them.
